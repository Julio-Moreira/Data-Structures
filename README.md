# Data Structures

Data structures with algorithms are part of the fundamentals of programming, so it is very important to study them.
So in this project i'll create all of data structures in php!

_\*all code and explanation in this repository is based in [learning javascript data structures and algorithms - Loiane Groner](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-JavaScript-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Third-Edition), i just transformed this code from js to php with several modifications_

## What are data structures?

In computing, we usually use various types of data that have some relationship between them. The way in which these data will be organized depends a lot on how they will used and processed. **These diverse forms of organization are called data structures**. 

## Technologies
For this project I use pure php to code of data structures, pest for tests and mermaid for diagramming
